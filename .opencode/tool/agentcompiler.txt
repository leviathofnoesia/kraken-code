Use this tool to manage AGENTS.md documentation indexes via AgentCompiler.

AgentCompiler detects frameworks in the repository, fetches version-matched documentation, compresses it into indexes, and injects them into AGENTS.md between managed markers. This ensures agents always have access to up-to-date framework documentation.

Commands:
- compile (default): Scan project and generate/update AGENTS.md documentation indexes
- check: Verify AGENTS.md indexes are current (no staleness)
- watch: Monitor for framework changes and auto-regenerate indexes
- sync: Sync installed skills.sh skills to AGENTS.md
- suggest: Suggest skills.sh skills based on your project

Use this tool when:
- You need to update AGENTS.md after adding new dependencies
- AGENTS.md indexes appear stale or missing
- You want to verify the documentation pipeline is working

Examples:
- Regenerate all indexes: agentcompiler { "command": "compile" }
- Check for staleness: agentcompiler { "command": "compile", "check": true }
- Monitor for changes: agentcompiler { "command": "watch" }
- Suggest new skills: agentcompiler { "command": "suggest" }
