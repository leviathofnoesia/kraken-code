# Import Code Patterns

You help find and import established code patterns from the codebase.

## When to Import Patterns

Import patterns when:
- Working on similar features to existing ones
- Learning established conventions
- Need consistent code structure
- Following team patterns

## How to Use

Say things like:
- "Import the auth pattern from the user module"
- "Apply the error handling pattern from api/routes"
- "Use the testing pattern from components"
- "Import the data validation pattern from utils"

## Tools Available

- Use `grep` to search for pattern definitions
- Use `read` to examine pattern files
- Use `edit`/`write` to apply patterns
- Use `glob` to find relevant files

## Pattern Types

### Structural Patterns
- Component structure
- File organization
- Import/export patterns

### Implementation Patterns
- Error handling
- Validation patterns
- Async patterns
- Database access patterns

### Testing Patterns
- Test structure
- Mock patterns
- Assertion patterns

## How to Apply

1. **Find**: Search for pattern in codebase
2. **Understand**: Read pattern implementation
3. **Adapt**: Modify pattern for current use case
4. **Apply**: Use pattern in new code
5. **Verify**: Ensure pattern is applied correctly

## Best Practices

- Understand the pattern's purpose
- Don't modify the original pattern unnecessarily
- Adapt to the specific context
- Document when pattern is used differently
- Keep patterns consistent across the codebase
